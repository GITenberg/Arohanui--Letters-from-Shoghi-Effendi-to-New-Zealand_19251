<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The word “Arohanui” is a Maori word and, as
with many Polynesian words, there is no direct translation into
English. The literal meaning is “big love”, or “much
love” or “great love”. And, like most words in most
languages, it has several meanings. In naming this book, “Arohanui:
Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand”, “Arohanui”
is used in its more expressive meaning, “enfolding love”,
or “that love which binds a community together”, or “that
love which creates bonds of mutual trust and loyalty”, or “that
love which builds and carries forward culture or civilization”.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My dear Bahá’í sister,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your beautiful letter of April 3rd written to the
Beloved Guardian of the Cause of God, our dear Shoghi Effendi, was
received.[+E1] He was much impressed and charmed with the spirit of
your letter, which indicated deep devotion to and absolute dependence
on the Holy Spirit of the Beloved Master, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He instructed me with a heart overflowing with love to
answer your letter, conveying to you his high estimation for the
beauty of the faith of the New Zealand friends, and deep appreciation
towards the splendid services of our dear Mr and Mrs Dunn,[+E2] who
are so wonderfully blessed and assisted by the power of the Holy
Ghost. He loves you all and prays for your happiness and spiritual
growth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is true that your group is now still small, but he
assures you that your group will before long grow larger and larger
day by day. It has been always the case with the growth of every
religion. Some pure soul or souls go to some land and sow the seeds
of the heavenly teachings in the hearts of few who are most pure and
so most receptive. The seeds will germinate and grow in them. The
fruits of these seeds appear in the regeneration of the lives of
these primary adherents. These primary adherents share the bounties
they have received with other souls, who through them obtain new life
and light and in turn illumine other people.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The primary adherents are the stars of great magnitude
in every land in the firmament of the Kingdom of God. They are the
chosen people. They are like candles which, through their sacrificial
efforts, are weeping their lives away in order to give light to the
world and establish the purpose of their Lord and Saviour, which
purpose is the salvation of mankind. His Holiness, Jesus Christ! see
how small the group of His disciples was! No matter how few the
number of the disciples was, yet they through His power illumined the
world. Our Era is similar to that, but through the development of
humanity it is greater, and through the evils of the material
civilization and negligence of mankind our sacrifices must be
greater. Divine light must make itself manifest in our daily life
deeds.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the early days of the appearance of our Saviour,
virtue was to save ourselves. When we are once established in our
faith, then virtue is to save others. The three mottoes of education
hold true in our case too. First grow, then become and then
contribute. We have developed; we have established ourselves, and now
it is time to contribute to others. We have inexhaustible capital.
The candles of our spiritual lives constantly weep away their lives
in shedding light to the world, but they never become exhausted. For
there is connection between our lives and that of Bahá’u’lláh
and our beloved ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It cannot be described how much we long to see our dear
New Zealand brethren and sisters. We hope the day will come when they
can come to us and we to them. Meanwhile, we are praying at the Holy
Threshold of our beloved Master for your success and happiness. We
hope you will pray for us too. The effect of the prayers of the pure
hearts is tremendously great.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our dear Shoghi Effendi wants you not to look at your
own capacity, but at the power of the Holy Ghost of God. He sends you
all his loving greeting and tender affection.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With warm wishes and Bahá’í love, I
remain,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Sister,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi was very pleased to receive this morning
your letter of 28th April, but we were very sorry to hear you have
been ill and hope your health will soon be completely restored.[+E3]
It was nice that you saw Shoghi’s sister and Soheil’s
brother in London.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I forget whether I gave you the address of Mr and Mrs
King, c/o Messrs Hayman and King, 202 Old Christchurch Rd.
Bournemouth. They are very kind-hearted Bahá’ís
and will be delighted to see any of you if you call. Both of them
work in the business and you are most likely to see them if you call
there. They live above the shop.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I gave you Sister Challis’s address at West Moors
(Ferndown Lodge). You can get there by ’bus from Bournemouth
Sq. or Lansdowne, which will drop you right at Sister Challis’s
door (She keeps a nursing home) or you can go by train from West
Bournemouth to West Moors station which is within 5 minutes’
walk of Ferndown Lodge. I hope you will be able to see her.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As I write, the Greatest Holy Leaf is on a visit to the
Shrine of the Master. It is over a year, I think, since she has been
able to visit the shrine and until now she has not seen the new
Gardens, in the laying out of which Shoghi Effendi has taken such a
deep interest. The Gardens are looking lovely now and it is easy to
imagine how delighted she will be. One day during the feast of Ridván
she and the Holy Mother were able to visit Bahjí and the
Garden of Ridván.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have quite recovered from my pleurisy now and am
steadily regaining my strength.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi is still tired. I hope he will soon be
able to take a rest.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All the friends here join in loving greetings and best
wishes to yourself, your son and daughter, Miss Stevenson and Effie
Baker.[+E4] With warmest greetings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Greatest Holy Leaf and Shoghi Effendi have asked me
to answer on their behalf your kind letters of Apr. 2nd from Port
Said and April 14th from London.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We were sorry to hear that Mrs Blundell got a chill on
the steamer and was laid up for a few days after her arrival in
London. We hope that by this time she is all right again. We had a
note from her from Bournemouth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You will be glad to hear that the Greatest Holy Leaf and
the Holy Mother were able to motor to Bahjí and Ridván
one day during the Feast of Ridván, and that yesterday the
Greatest Holy Leaf motored to the Shrine of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
and saw the new Gardens in which Shoghi Effendi has been taking so
much interest.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yesterday a Dutchman arrived here from Port Said, the
first Dutch Bahá’í, so far as we know. He has
been a sincere and earnest truth-seeker for years. About 9 months ago
he left his home at the Hague and walked on foot through Belgium,
France and Italy. Then he felt some inward urge to go to Egypt, and
travelled thither by a Dutch Cargo Steamer. When the steamer arrived
at Port Said Mahmood Effendi, one of the Port Said Bahá’ís
came on board and was introduced to Mesdag (the Dutchman). They
struck up a friendship at once and after 2 days Mesdag went to live
in Mahmood’s house. There he met Martha Root, Mr Schopflocher
and various other Bahá’ís, read my book and
became thoroughly interested and seems now already a firm believer.
He has already, since his arrival yesterday morning, translated our
8-page folder into Dutch and we hope he will be able to do much to
make the Cause known in Holland and win adherents there.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have quite recovered from my pleurisy now and am
feeling almost as vigorous as before the attack. Azizullah Bahadur is
now in Stuttgart. There is as yet no improvement in his hand, but he
is having skilled treatment now and we hope it will be successful. He
seems to be having a very happy time with the German friends.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi is much in need of rest, but fairly well.
He and all the members of the Holy Family join in loving greetings
and heartfelt prayers for your welfare. We hope you will have a fine
time in England and return to New Zealand refreshed and reinvigorated
physically and spiritually to take up your work for the Kingdom there
with new enthusiasm and devotion. We pray that you may always be
guided and strengthened by the Divine Confirmations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Brother,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi has asked me to reply to your kind letter
of 11th April. He is delighted to hear that you propose starting a
Bahá’í Magazine for Australia and New Zealand and
suggests as a suitable title “The Herald of the South”.
Every 19 days a letter will be sent from Haifa to Mr and Mrs Hyde
Dunn giving the news of the Cause. Owing to the restricted facilities
for multiplying copies which are at present available here, I fear it
will not be possible to send another copy to you, but doubtless you
can arrange with Mr and Mrs Hyde Dunn to have their copy passed on to
you for the magazine. We are glad to hear that notwithstanding the
absence of the Blundells and Margaret Stevenson, the friends in New
Zealand are remaining united and active. We hope that when the
pilgrims return the faith and enthusiasm of the believers will be
greatly deepened and strengthened and that many new believers may be
attracted. I had a long letter from Effie Baker yesterday. She is
very devoted and whole-hearted and will be a valuable worker for the
Cause, I think, and a great help to Father and Mother Dunn. When she
wrote, Margaret Stevenson had gone to Scotland and Mrs and Miss
Blundell were in Bournemouth. Effie Baker hopes to make a return
visit to Haifa on her way back to Australia.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi assures you of his prayers on behalf of
your mother, yourself and all the Australasian friends and his hopes
that the proposed Magazine may greatly help the spread of the Glad
Tidings in Australia and New Zealand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With warmest greetings and best wishes,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Sister,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi asks me to thank you on his behalf for
your letter of 14th May. He received the letter of Mrs. Amy Thornton
all right. I remember answering it for him some weeks ago, so you can
set your mind at rest on that score.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The recovery of your Bahá’í ring and
stones was very remarkable. It reminds me of a somewhat similar
occurrence in Bournemouth. One of our Bahá’í
friends had her Bahá’í ring stolen, and nothing
was heard or seen of it for some months. Mr King, another of our
group, has an antique shop in Bournemouth and one day his partner (a
non-Bahá’í) bought a ring from a man who said it
was his wife’s, but as they had become very badly off she
wanted to sell it. When Mr King saw the ring he recognized it as a
Bahá’í ring and knowing that this friend had lost
her ring, he sent it to me. It turned out to be her ring and she was
delighted to recover it. The curious thing is that out of the dozens
of jewellers and antique shops in Bournemouth to which the ring might
have been taken for sale, it should be taken to the one where there
was a Bahá’í who recognized it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I hope that before you leave Scotland you may be able to
go to Aberdeen and see my home people. They would be delighted to see
you. My father’s address is Fairford, Cults, (about 3 miles
from Aberdeen, by car or train). He is 86 years of age and rather
frail. My sister looks after him. My two married brothers are Peter
Esslemont, 21, Louisville Avenue (Business: John E. Esslemont, 16
King Street) and W.D.E., 12 Wellbrae Terr., Mannofield. Both of their
houses are near the Mannofield Car Line.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We were very glad to hear of your meetings with the
friends at London and West Moors.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many thanks for your letter to myself and the excellent
snap-shots enclosed. I am glad you have fallen in love with Sister
Challis and hope you will see her again before you leave. I had a
delightful letter yesterday from Miss Kilford of West Moors, whom I
regard as a Bahá’í grand-daughter, as she was
brought into the Cause by Sister Challis who calls me her Bahá’í
father!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We hope Shoghi Effendi will get away soon for a much
needed rest. The Greatest Holy Leaf was rather seriously ill last
week, but is a good deal better again, although very feeble and
frail.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have been advised by the Drs to leave Haifa for the
summer months, as my breathing has lately been troublesome and they
think the moist heat during the summer here would be bad for me. On
the same day on which this decision was arrived at, I received a
cordial invitation to go to a place in the Black Forest for my summer
vacation. The Drs considered this place would be ideal for me and
that the sooner I got away the better, so I leave in 3 days time. My
address will be c/o Frau Victoria von Sigsfeld, Husli, Finsterlingen,
bei St Blaisien, Baden, Germany. I hope to return to Haifa in the
latter part of Sept. to resume my work here.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi is very glad that you have enjoyed your

the first issue of the Bahá’í Journal, recently
established by the friends of Australia and New Zealand. I rejoice in
this new and notable Bahá’í enterprise,

self-sacrificing brothers and sisters in a land which holds so great
a promise for the future.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span style="font-style: italic">I have followed the progress of the activities of the

interest and ever-increasing confidence, and with a deep sense of
pride and gratitude. I most heartily welcome this newly-added link in
the chain of the many services, so lovingly and spontaneously
rendered by the pioneers of the Cause in these lands. I assure you of
my steadfast prayers for the speedy expansion and consolidation of
this youngest of all Bahá’í Magazines, and of my
earnest endeavours to enable it attain a standard worthy of the
bearer of such a noble Message.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span style="font-style: italic">It should be the object and purpose of its author and

matters that are strictly Bahá’í in character, as
well as to the treatment of topics of a humanitarian, ethical and

and broad-minded attitude of the Bahá’í Cause,
may receive from it their full share of inspiration which only a
clear and direct statement of the Divine Message can impart.</span></p>

we all love her so; she is so sweet and helpful.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have just now two American lady friends with us,

Effy in London and shall look forward to the pleasure of meeting you

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am back at home now for the present, and I am trying
to help Shoghi Effendi a little in his enormous task.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He is keeping in good health I am glad to say in spite

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">My very dear Spiritual Sister:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi has been in receipt of your interesting
letter dated June 7, 1926. It is a great pity that your health has
more or less handicapped you in your service to the Cause. We,
however, hope that this weakness will soon vanish and your health and
strength be fully restored.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The case of the teacher who has been in Palestine is one
really to be lamented. All such persons instead of procuring their
information from the very source, when they are so near to it, they
go to the Missionaries who are undoubtedly biased. They are
immediately told that the Cause is nothing more than a sect of Islam;
a Movement that may do immense good to the Muḥammadan world,
but far from ranking with Christianity or satisfying its needs. Then
they refer this ignorant and innocent person to books such as
Brown’s. It is their fault for having gone to the wrong source
for proper information, but once they have gone it is not their
mistake to have been misled. We have heard of many such instances and
there is absolutely no remedy except to leave them until they find
the truth for themselves. We can only pray for their guidance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi always prays for you as well as the other
Auckland friends, so that through your combined efforts the Cause may
prosper there, and obtain a strong position in the life of the
people. I am not the least familiar with the social conditions there,
but I am sure there is a ready field for active service.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of
your letter dated June 7, 1926. It was most interesting to go over
your circular letter and read the many points of interest. I was
especially struck by the literature you have sent to Lord and Lady
Allenby. If they have at all seen them I am sure they were much
impressed, for they knew the Master so well. They were surely very
astonished to see a group of Bahá’ís formed in
such a distant land.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am very ashamed of myself not to have yet answered
your letter of some months ago. It was mainly because Shoghi Effendi
wrote you and acknowledged the receipt of your contribution for the
pilgrim house that I have been so neglectful. I took Miss Baker’s
advice on the matter and together we went down-town and bought a set
of straw chairs. We thought that would be most appreciated by the
friends while sitting in the veranda of the new Pilgrim House.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I remember a prayer, which you wrote, has been asked by
a certain friend to be read daily. I believe sometimes the friends
through their zeal and ardour do things that are not asked in the
Cause. We have only one prayer that we have to say daily. No one in
the world has the power, given to him by Bahá’u’lláh
to add another to that daily prayer. If we should admit this the life
of the friends will soon be spent in mere prayer, which is not the
aim of the Cause. The healing prayer and such ones are only for
occasional use when the need arises.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to extend to you his hearty
greetings and assure you of his prayers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Spiritual Sister:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of
your letter dated September 13th 1926. He was most gratified to read
the nice and encouraging news it contained.[+E5] He hopes that the
“Herald of the South” will daily increase in importance
and now that it is coming out in printed form, obtain a great number
of readers. You should try from the very start to maintain a high
standard for its articles. They should be broad in view, clear in
style and scholarly in their development of the different subjects.
In short the ‘public’ should be taught to consider it as
a paper fully worthwhile to read and meditate upon. Shoghi Effendi
will remember in his prayers all those who are working in this noble
field of service.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi desires that you should extend his loving
greetings to all the friends in Auckland. He hopes that through their
endeavours and the Master’s invisible guiding hand they will
succeed to raise the standard of the Cause in that land to such
heights that it will arouse the interest of all the seeking souls and
in due time win their support.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The members of the Master’s family are well and
send you their loving greetings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span style="font-style: italic">I shall pray from all my heart for the steady
development and the growing influence of the “Herald of the
South”. May its voice grow in strength and power, and may its
pages increasingly reflect the dynamic spirit of the Faith and mirror
forth the ever-expanding activities of the friends in Australasia as
well as in distant lands. Persevere in your efforts, let not
obstacles damp your zeal and determination and rest assured that the
Power of God which is reinforcing your efforts will in the end
triumph and enable you to fulfil your cherished desire.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Sister,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our beloved Guardian has asked me to write to you for
him. He is very pleased with your letter of Dec. 8th which reached
him on Jan. 10th and he is very glad to hear of your activities in
New Zealand. He will pray earnestly that your sincere efforts to make
Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation widely known
will bring forth much fruit and have a great result. In the newer
countries minds are more open, and the people more ready and willing
to receive this Great Message.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to the Queen of Rumania’s 3
articles--he will see that you receive them correctly. He
considers the last one in which she acknowledges Muḥammad as a
true Prophet of God to have great importance for the East and
especially in Persia. This evening, I personally have had a most
interesting conversation with Dr. Habíb of Kermanshah[+E6] who
is now on a visit to Shoghi Effendi with his wife and little girl. He
was telling us of the continued fanaticism of the Moslems of
Persia--and how during two periods of the year especially, the
fanatical Mullahs preach against the Bahá’ís from
their pulpits--saying to the ignorant “No matter what evil
things you have done during your life, or what sins you have
committed, if you kill a Bahá’í who is an enemy
of Islam, or even if you take his property or severely injure him,
all your own sins will be wiped out and forgiven for the sake of this
good deed of destroying an enemy of the Faith!!”--in this
way they incite the people to deeds of violence and persecution. He
said that the Bahá’í teachings are spreading
rapidly amongst the more educated classes--but it is difficult
to teach the very poor and ignorant fanatical people--tho’
when they do become Believers, they are very strong and faithful. The
2 periods of particular danger for the Bahá’ís in
Persia are the fast month and the period of Moharram[+E7]--which
lasts for 8 weeks.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi is very interested to hear of the
engagement of your son to a Bahá’í young lady--and
he prays that in future they may do a great work for the “Cause”.
He hopes so much that you will recover your full health and strength,
and he will pray especially for that. It is good to know that
Esperanto is increasingly studied in New Zealand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He will certainly pray for Miss Palter<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
and her Mother as you ask him to do--and also for your dear son
and your two daughters. Please accept all best wishes from myself and
Believe me</p>

your letter dated Dec. 2nd 1931. He is very sorry that you cannot on
your way to New Zealand, break your journey and come over for a short
visit to Haifa. But these are such difficult days that we should not

that on your way you will meet the friends, especially those in Port

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was also very sorry to hear that Bertram has to give
up his studies and return home. Shoghi Effendi hopes that this period
he spent in America would be itself an education that would help him
in his work in serving the Cause. His activities with the young
people there should have made him very experienced and have deepened
his understanding of the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I believe Mrs Dunn is planning to come this spring for a
visit to Haifa. Perhaps you will meet her before she starts, Shoghi

Cause into Australia and has been so self-sacrificing in her
services.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi wishes me to thank you[+E8] for your kind
letter of March 16th 1933, as well as the enclosed article which has
been translated by Mr. Paul into the Maori language.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian has already written Mr. Paul and expressed
to him his deep appreciation for the service he has rendered to the
Faith, but especially to his own people who through the means of such
literature will be acquainted with the teachings and will receive the
light of guidance brought to the world by Bahá’u’lláh.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I believe the Guardian has already intimated his
approval of this pamphlet and the desire that the friends in
Australia publish and circulate it among the Maoris.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the passages in the sacred writings
indicating the wrath of God; Shoghi Effendi says that the Divinity
has many attributes: He is loving and merciful but also just. Just as
reward and punishment, according to Bahá’u’lláh,
are the pillars upon which society rests, so mercy and justice may be
considered as their counterpart in the world to come. Should we
disobey God and work against His commands He will view our acts in
the light of justice and punish us for it. That punishment may not be
in the form of fire, as some believe, but in the form of spiritual
deprivation and degradation. This is why we read so often in the
prayers statements such as “God do not deal with us with
justice, but rather through thy infinite mercy.” The wrath of
God is in the administration of His justice, both in this world and
in the world to come. A God that is only loving or only just is not a
perfect God. The divinity has to possess both of these aspects as
every father ought to express both in his attitude towards his
children. If we ponder a while, we will see that our welfare can be
insured only when both of these divine attributes are equally
emphasised and practiced.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In closing may I express the Guardian’s loving
greetings and best wishes for the progress of your work in serving
the Cause.</p>

inevitable. You should, therefore, try all your best to carry aflame
within you the torch of faith, for through it you will surely find
guidance, strength and eventual success.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian is fully conscious of the difficulties that
impede the progress of the Faith in your community. Chief among
these, you mention the lack of courage and of initiative on the part
of the believers, and a feeling of inferiority complex which prevents
them from addressing the public. It is precisely these weaknesses
that he wishes the friends to overcome, for these do not only
paralyze their efforts but actually serve to quench the flame of
faith in their hearts. Not until all the friends come to realize that
every one of them is able, in his own measure, to deliver the
Message, can they ever hope to reach the goal that has been set
before them by a loving and wise Master. It is no use waiting for
some able and eloquent teacher to take all the responsibility for the
spread of the Cause. For such a thing is not only contrary to the
spirit of the Teachings but to the explicit text of the writings of
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
both of whom place the obligation of teaching not on any particular
class, as in former ecclesiastical organizations, but on every
faithful and loyal follower of the Cause. The teaching of the Word is
thus made universal and compulsory. How long then shall we wait to
carry out this command, the full wisdom of which only future
generations will be able to appreciate? We have no special teachers
in the Cause. Everyone is a potential teacher. He has only to use
what God has given him and thus prove that he is faithful to his
trust.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Visiting teachers, who are, at least in a general way,
supposed to be more competent and able than the rest, are undoubtedly
of a great help. But these can never replace the mass of individual
believers and fulfil what must be inevitably accomplished through the
collective effort and wisdom of the community at large. What visiting
teachers are supposed to do is to give the final touch to the work
that has been done, to consolidate rather than supplement individual
efforts and thereby direct them in a constructive and suitable
channel. Their task is to encourage and inspire individual believers,
and to broaden and deepen their vision of the task that is to be
done. And this, not by virtue of any inherent spiritual right, but in
the spirit of simple and whole-hearted cooperation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is in this light that Shoghi Effendi views the whole
problem of teaching not only in New Zealand but in all the Bahá’í
world. He would, therefore, encourage you to take a leading part in
the carrying out of his wishes on this point, to take yourself an
active interest in teaching, not only private but also public, and in
this way stimulate the friends to follow your example. It is then,
and only then, that there can be a need for a qualified and competent
visiting teacher in order to bring to full fruition individual
teaching efforts.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Assuring you of our Guardian’s fervent prayers on
your behalf, so that you may be increasingly blessed in your efforts
for the spread of the Message.</p>

you and to the bereaved members of your family, his heartfelt
condolences and sympathy for this severe loss which you have
sustained.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mrs Blundell’s departure is, indeed, a loss not
only to her family, but also to the community of her fellow-believers
in New Zealand. For in her they have come to lose one of their oldest
and most distinguished co-workers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian well remembers her pilgrimage to the Holy
Land, and has always cherished the hope that she would once more be
enabled to visit the shrines. But alas, her departed soul has taken
its flight from this world, leaving her friends and relatives in a
state of profoundest grief. Their only consolation now is the
realization that through her painstaking and sustained labours for
the Cause in Auckland Mrs Blundell has left an abiding monument to
her memory, and one which will continue for many years to come to
inspire and strengthen them all in their collective endeavours for
the establishment of the Faith in New Zealand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi is fervently praying for the soul of our
departed sister, and is entreating Bahá’u’lláh

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Sister,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your very cordial message of the 17th November addressed
to our beloved Guardian has duly reached him, and he has noted with
keen appreciation indeed the desire you had expressed of visiting the
Holy Shrines on your way back to New-Zealand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As you must have surely read in the newspapers, however,
the general situation in Palestine is at present so gravely disturbed
as to make it quite impossible for you to undertake this trip in the
next few months, and in view of this the Guardian would advise that
you postpone your visit until the November of next year, by which
time, it is hoped, the situation throughout the country will have
sufficiently improved to permit you to undertake this long-cherished
pilgrimage. The Guardian, needless to say, would be also most
delighted to meet you, and to hear from you directly of the news of
the Cause in New-Zealand, and to discuss certain matters which the
N.S.A.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a>
has asked you to present to him for his instructions.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Regarding your question whether there is any special
ceremony which the believers should perform when they wish to “name”
a baby; the Teachings do not provide for any ceremony whatever on
such occasions. We have no “baptismal service” in the
Cause, such as the Christians have. There would be no objection,
however, for the friends to come together on such happy occasions,
provided they do not hold an official public ceremony, and provided
also they strictly avoid uniformity and rigidity in all such
practices. No rule whatsoever that would tend to be rigid and uniform
should be allowed in such secondary matters, particularly as there
are no specific instructions in the Teachings regarding them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the warmest good wishes of the Guardian to you and
to the friends, and assuring you again of his hearty welcome to visit
the Holy Shrines during next autumn, and with greetings,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yours in His Service, <br />
H. Rabbani</p>

you, and express in person my deep and abiding sense of appreciation
of the splendid and historic services you have rendered. I will

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Sister,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am directed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge the
receipt of your letter dated February 25th, informing him of the date
of your departure from England, and your inability to defer your
visit to Haifa till next November. He regrets indeed that you should
find it impossible to extend your stay in Europe and come to
Palestine in autumn, as the situation here is now so tense and
dangerous that there seems very little hope of any real amelioration
in security conditions to take place by next May. General conditions
throughout the country are, at present, even worse than a month ago,
and the tension is daily increasing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In case, however, security is reestablished by the time
you reach Port-Said, you would be welcome to visit the Shrines, but
the Guardian would be still away.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Wishing you again a successful and happy return home,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shoghi Effendi has instructed me to answer your letter
to him of May 10th, which just came.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was, as already expressed in the cable he sent you,
greatly impressed by the statement in the Quarterly on the true
Bahá’í attitude at the present time. It displayed
a correctness of viewpoint, a courage, and a loyalty to Bahá’u’lláh
which has led him to disseminate it far and wide: in the American
News Letter, in the two Haifa News Letters, English and Persian, etc.
It was indeed a timely and most noble contribution to the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The friends in both Australia and New Zealand seem to
have developed a most outstanding soundness in their relation to the
teachings. This leads Shoghi Effendi to believe that they will make
great contributions to the unfoldment of the world-wide aspects of
the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His prayers are always with you, and he most deeply
appreciates the splendid services you are rendering the Cause, and
will pray that the way will open for you to do even greater work and
in an ever widening field.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please assure all the dear friends of Auckland of his

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Brother:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Dec. 12th has
been received, and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf.
The previous letter you mention cannot have reached him, as he always
replies to letters from the friends.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your book[+E10] touches on a very important subject, and
he regrets that he cannot read it himself. His work is so pressing
and multiplying so fast that he invariably refuses to go over the
manuscripts the friends send him as he simply cannot attend to such
things as well as all his other work. You should send it to the
Reviewing Com. in the U.S.A. and ask their advice. Perhaps an outside
publisher would be interested in it? The Bahá’í
funds have such heavy demands made on them at present that even
essential literature must often wait to be published, unfortunately.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He fully appreciates the fact that the believers
locally, in different parts of the world, often feel that their
political party is in many ways striving to accomplish ideals akin to
our Bahá’í aims--but the fact remains that
the only way for the Bahá’ís to preserve their
international character, their unity and integrity, is for them
individually to sacrifice these desired political affiliations for
the universal good and protection of the Faith. There is no political
party in existence with whose platform we wholly agree, and we must
abstain from membership in such parties. Likewise people who join the
Faith must have the courage and conviction to leave their political
affiliations behind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no reason why this should cause enmity as they
are not joining another party, but a universal Faith striving for the
advancement of the entire human race. He thinks there is very little
possibility of any politician joining the Faith. The sacrifice of
such individuals’ personal ambitions is too great a one for
them to make. The condition of the world today is such that it is
obvious no political solution to its problems is going to be found.
We Bahá’ís must therefore concentrate on
Bahá’u’lláh’s World Order--the
true solution.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He assures you he will pray your teaching labours may be
very successful. He will also pray for your dear mother’s
welfare.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your letter of October 28 has been received, and our
beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First, let me say how very deeply he appreciates the
services you have been rendering our glorious Faith in Australia, and
particularly Perth, during the past two years. Your trip has been of
real assistance to the teaching work, and it pleased him greatly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Regarding Mr. ...: it was with the approval of the
Guardian that his name was removed from the voting list. It is very
bad for the Cause to have a member of the Community, actively, in the
public eye, teaching the Faith, and at the same time showing
dishonest characteristics. We cannot possibly say that because a
person also has many virtues, faults as grave as lying and
dishonourable conduct regarding money, can be overlooked! This means
that we tolerate as representatives of our Faith people who
flagrantly disobey its laws and fundamental teachings. This does not
mean there is no hope for Mr. ...; let him change his conduct, if he
really loves the Cause, and then a way will be opened for him to
again be active. But the change must be real and obvious; mere
protestations will serve no purpose.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He urges you to continue your services in the teaching
field in New Zealand, and also to write to the friends in Australia
who are disturbed about Mr. ..., and strengthen their faith and
determination.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Vicious criticism is indeed a calamity. But its root is
lack of faith in the system of Bahá’u’lláh
(i.e. the administrative order) and lack of obedience to Him--for
He has forbidden it. If the Bahá’ís would follow
the Bahá’í laws in voting, in electing, in
serving, and in abiding by assembly decisions, all this waste of
strength thru criticizing others could be diverted into cooperation
and achieving the Plan. Keep on trying to point this out to them!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Friends:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...I would like to add that the Guardian does not
consider that it is advisable for New Zealand to be separated in the
near future from Australia, and come under the jurisdiction of an
independent National Assembly. He considers that the present
arrangement is the best one until such time as there are more
assemblies flourishing in New Zealand, and he would consider the
basis for a National Assembly strong enough there to support such an
institution....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...He was very happy to see that Mrs Dunn was able to
attend the New Zealand Bahá’í Summer School. For
a woman of her age, this was surely a remarkable achievement, and
must have been a great inspiration to the New Zealand friends, coming

isolated centres, groups and local assemblies, in both Australia and
New Zealand--a process that has been steadily and rapidly
developing since the inauguration of the Ten-Year Plan, is likewise
of paramount importance in the years immediately ahead. The
development of these institutions, particularly in New Zealand, will
no doubt hasten the emergence of an independent National Spiritual
Assembly in that territory, and will lend a tremendous impetus to the
onward march of the Faith in those regions....</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...The news of the purchase of the Hazíratu’l-Quds

really one of the pre-requisites for the formation of the National

endowments in the Dominion of New Zealand is yet another
responsibility devolving upon their elected national representatives,
a responsibility which should be discharged prior to the emergence of
an independent national assembly in that distant and promising
island.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span style="font-style: italic">Whilst these immediate goals are being steadily and
resolutely pursued, attention should, likewise, be particularly
directed to the vital need for the constant multiplication of

necessity of increasing, to an unprecedented degree, the number of
the avowed adherents of the Faith who can directly and effectively
contribute to the broadening of its foundations and the expansion of
its nascent institutions. Particularly in the Dominion of New

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Message from the Guardian at the inception of the New
Zealand National Spiritual Assembly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I share with the assembled delegates, gathered to elect,
on this historic occasion, the second National Spiritual Assembly of
the Bahá’ís of the Antipodes, the feelings of
profound satisfaction and gratitude to Bahá’u’lláh
evoked by this epoch-making event in the evolution of His Faith in
that far off region of the globe. I am deeply conscious of the
decisive share which the Australian Bahá’í
Community, labouring during more than three decades, for the spread
of the light of this glorious revelation among the highly progressive
people of that distant continent, has had in the laying of the
foundations of the Administrative Order and the erection of yet
another pillar of the future Universal House of Justice in this
remote Dominion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The emergence of this independent Bahá’í
Community, no matter how limited its numerical strength and modest
its resources, must be regarded as a highly significant development
in the rise and establishment of the Bahá’í Faith
in the Pacific Area, and should synchronise with the formulation, on
the part of the National Spiritual Assembly now being elected in that
Island, of a subsidiary Six-Year-Plan, designed to reinforce
substantially the numerical strength of the Community; to multiply
its Centres, as well as its Local Spiritual Assemblies; to
incorporate the solidly grounded amongst them; to inaugurate a
National Fund; to obtain recognition for both the Bahá’í
marriage certificate and the Bahá’í Holy Days; to
lend an unprecedented impetus to the conversion of the Maoris, and to
ensure their active participation in the conduct of Bahá’í
Administrative Institutions; to extend the scope of the work already
initiated in the South Island; to incorporate the newly formed
National Spiritual Assembly, and to select and acquire a site for the
first Ma<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">sh</span></span>riqu’l-A<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">dh</span></span>kár of that Dominion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I call upon the members of the Australian National
Spiritual Assembly, as well as the members of the Australian Bahá’í
Community, to continue to lend their valued support to this newly
pledged sister Community, and to enable it, through the extension of
material assistance as well as the dispatch of visiting teachers and
pioneers, to contribute, in an ever increasing measure, to the
furtherance of the magnificent and colossal campaign now being so
vigorously conducted in the North, in the South, and in the heart of
the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">May the outpourings of the Holy Spirit continue to
energise this small yet resolute forward marching, dedicated
community, and may the outcome of the collective efforts of its
members contribute decisively to the triumphant consummation of the
World Crusade on which the entire body of the followers of the Faith
of Bahá’u’lláh have so confidently
embarked.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Sister:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I am instructed by our beloved Guardian to write you on
his behalf and assure you he was most happy to receive your letter
dated May 4.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He rejoices with the New Zealand Bahá’ís
in the formation of their historic National Assembly. They are now
firmly launched on the course of their own destiny, and undoubtedly
the Faith will go forward very much faster. They have an advantage
not shared by many of their fellow National Assemblies, of
exclusively administering the affairs of the Faith in a small area,
which means that they can function much more efficiently. When one
remembers the many years that the New Zealand and Australian
believers toiled to carry on the work in those two countries, with
the sea in between, and inadequate funds to provide transportation,
which necessitated so much of the National Assembly’s work
being carried on by correspondence, one can appreciate the advantages
you now enjoy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The formation of a new National Body in any case is an
organic thing, and a new and lively flow of life will go out into all
the members of the Community from this Assembly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the question you asked him about the site for
the Temple, this need not be a large piece of land at this time--three
or four acres would be sufficient for the site if you find suitable
land is expensive. If the worst comes to the worst, when the time
comes to build the Temple, the site can be changed. In Uganda some
years ago, they purchased a Temple site, and later, a large piece of
land for their endowment. With the Guardian’s permission, they
exchanged the two as the Endowment’s position was better for
the Temple. So you see, it need not be too rigid. The point is to get
a Temple site as soon as possible. He feels it should be in the
outskirts of Auckland, within easy motoring distance, so that the
friends can attend services there. Naturally the closer to the city,
the better.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As you formulate your plans and carry them out for the
work entrusted to you during the next six years, he wishes you to
particularly bear in mind the need of teaching the Maoris. These
original discoverers of New Zealand are of a very fine race, and they
are a people long admired for their noble qualities; and special
effort should be made, not only to contact the Maoris in the cities
and draw them into the Faith, but to go to their towns and live
amongst them and establish Assemblies in which at least the majority
of the believers will be Maoris, if not all. This would be indeed a
worthy achievement.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beloved Guardian assures you all of his prayers for
the success of the historic work you are now undertaking, and he
feels sure you will achieve your goals.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With warmest Bahá’í greetings,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span style="font-style: italic">Dear and valued co-workers:</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span style="font-style: italic">The emergence of the New Zealand National Spiritual
Assembly, as a result of the convocation of the first Bahá’í
historic Convention held in that far-away and promising Dominion,
will be hailed by posterity as an event of the greatest significance,
marking the erection of another pillar designed to support, in the
South Pacific area, the future Universal House of Justice. My heart
overflows with happiness and is filled with gratitude as I
contemplate the splendid progress achieved, in recent years, in that
far-off island, and note the loyalty and devotion with which the
members of this valiant community, now standing on the threshold of
unprecedented achievements, have discharged their manifold and sacred
responsibilities.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span style="font-style: italic">The six brief years that now lie ahead must witness a
swift expansion in the scope of Bahá’í activities
throughout the length and breadth of that Dominion, as well as a
steady consolidation of the foundations of the institutions that have
been so painstakingly laid. The Six-Year Plan upon which the New
Zealand believers have now so auspiciously embarked must be
diligently prosecuted and brought to a triumphant conclusion. All
must participate, whether young or old, veterans as well as newly
enrolled believers, all must contribute their share to the ultimate
success of this mighty collective enterprise, however limited their
means, however modest their abilities, however restricted the range
of their previous experiences.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span style="font-style: italic">The increase in the number of the avowed adherents of
the Faith; the multiplication of isolated centres, groups, and local
assemblies; the incorporation of the newly formed National Spiritual
Assembly as well as all firmly grounded local assemblies; the
recognition of the Bahá’í marriage certificate by
the civil authorities, and of the Bahá’í Holy
Days by the Superintendent of schools in that island; the rapid
conversion of the Maoris and their close association with the white
believers in the administration of the affairs of the community; the
consolidation of the work energetically initiated in the South
Island; the selection and purchase of the site for the Mother Temple
of New Zealand--these stand out as the foremost objectives of
the Plan now demanding of its high minded determined prosecutors, the
utmost consecration, unrelaxing vigilance and the noblest
self-sacrifice.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span style="font-style: italic">The tasks, challenging the spirit and resources of this
community, whose numerical strength is as yet so limited, whose
material resources are so circumscribed, whose past experiences have,
in many respects, been confined to a narrow range, are truly
formidable. The alloted time, during which so stupendous an
undertaking is to be consummated, is short. The obstacles confronting
its members are varied and manifold. Yet the sustaining grace
promised to all those who will arise, with single-mindedness,
courage, dedication and high resolve to aid in the attainment of
these noble objectives, is of such potency that no earthly power can
resist the ultimate fulfilment of so glorious a task, or even delay
its eventual fruition.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span style="font-style: italic">I appeal most earnestly to all those who, in both the
teaching and administrative fields, are committed to carry out so
magnificent an enterprise, as well as to those who, in an unofficial
capacity, are called upon to further, by every means in their power,
the interests of this epoch-making Plan, to dedicate themselves, at
this hour to the arduous, yet infinitely precious task they have
shouldered, and to devote, in the days and years that lie ahead,
every ounce of their energy to the systematic prosecution of a Plan,
on which the immediate destinies of the entire New Zealand Bahá’í
community directly depend; and which can alone provide the
stepping-stone to the still more brilliant achievements destined to
ennoble the annals of the Faith in that remote island of the globe.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">...As regards the “Herald of the South”
magazine, in view of the important work lying ahead of your Assembly,
and the fact that this magazine is a drain on the limited resources
of the Community, he thinks it would be quite all right to suspend
publication until a future date when the financial situation permits
such expenditures to be made with relative ease. He leaves, however,
the final decision to your Assembly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Committee responsible for the publication of this
magazine has certainly laboured valiantly throughout the years, and
the publication will be missed by its readers. However, it is some
years since the American Bahá’í Magazine was
abandoned for similar reasons, and the Guardian feels that you can do
so in Australia, and the funds be used to better advantage, at this
time. However, now that you have found a printer in Sydney and
appointed a new committee, he thinks you should continue it and give
the new Plan a try....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The successful culmination of the long standing
partnership of the Australian and New Zealand believers thru the
emergence of the New Zealand N. S. A. is a source of great
satisfaction to the Guardian, and no doubt to all the members of both
communities. He feels sure this will mark a turning point in the work
in the Antipodes and the neighbouring islands and give a new lease of
life to the teaching work throughout that area. Both your Assembly
and that of New Zealand have now emerged into your permanent form as
pillars of the future International House of Justice. The bones of
the skeleton of the World Order are growing strong, but only the
teaching work can clothe them with flesh....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We cannot prove man was always man for this is a
fundamental doctrine, but it is based on the assertion that nothing
can exceed its own potentialities, that everything, a stone, a tree,
an animal and a human being existed in plan, potentially, from the
very “beginning” of creation. We don’t believe man
has always had the form of man, but rather that from the outset he
was going to evolve into the human form and species and not be a
haphazard branch of the ape family.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You see our whole approach to each matter is based on
the belief that God sends us divinely inspired Educators; what they
tell us is fundamentally true, what science tells us today is true;
tomorrow may be entirely changed to better explain a new set of
facts.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá says man breaks the
laws of nature, He means we shape nature to meet our own needs, as no
animal does. Animals adapt themselves to better fit in with and
benefit from their environment. But men both surmount and change
environment. Likewise when He says nature is devoid of memory He
means memory as we have it, not the strange memory of inherited
habits which animals so strikingly possess.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These various statements must be taken in conjunction
with all the Bahá’í teachings; we cannot get a
correct picture by concentrating on just one phrase.</p>

articles for publication in that magazine as would serve to make it a
more direct and effective teaching medium for the spread of the Cause
throughout Australia and New-Zealand. He is advising the American N.
S. A. to specially ask the cooperation of the American believers for
that purpose, and hopes that the response they will make to this call
will be such as to further encourage you in your splendid efforts for
the publication of this national organ of the Faith....</p>

October number of the “Herald of the South” entitled
“Above the Mists”; the Guardian wishes the believers to
disregard such subjects as psychic practices and phenomena, for these
besides not being authenticated by the Writings of the Founders of
the Faith, pertain mostly to the domain of conjectures. The magazines
of the “Herald of the South” should be devoted to the
study and presentation of those subjects that reflect the spirit of
the Teachings, and which as such are worthy of consideration by the
believers. As the national organ of the Australian and New-Zealand
friends its main function is to assist in disseminating the knowledge
of the Cause, and thus develop into an effective teaching medium.
This is the goal which the editors should have constantly in mind,
and which they should endeavour to attain through the best possible
means they can devise at present....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must not take many of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
statements as dogmatic finalities, for there are other points which
when added to them round out the picture. For instance, when He calls
Aristotle and Plato Philosophers of the East, He is obviously placing
them in that category because He believes they belong more correctly
to Eastern culture than to Central European and the New World
cultures of the West. When He calls the philosophers of the West
materialistic this does not for a moment mean He includes all Western
philosophers for, as you truly point out, many of them have been very
spiritual in their concepts....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Historians cannot be sure Socrates did not visit the
Holy Land. But believing as we do that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
had an intuitive knowledge quite different from our own, we accept
His authority on this matter....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to the Scout movement, they afford a great
disciplinary lesson to the young boys and girls provided they are not
prepared directly for the army. In some towns here we have in some of
the schools Scout troops who are also students of the Colleges and it
has proved to be a great educational scheme for helping the
development of the children but they are never taught to carry arms
or even the use of firearms. And furthermore they are often taught
the evils of war rather than encourage them to become in future
active soldiers with imperialistic designs. This of course is my own
personal view.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When studying at present, in English, the available
Bahá’í writings on the subject of body, soul and
spirit, one is handicapped by a certain lack of clarity because not
all were translated by the same person, and also there are, as you
know, still many Bahá’í writings untranslated.
But there is no doubt that spirit and soul seem to have been
interchanged in meaning sometimes; soul and mind have, likewise, been
interchanged in meaning, no doubt due to difficulties arising from
different translations. What the Bahá’ís do
believe though is that we have three aspects of our humanness, so to
speak, a body, a mind and an immortal identity--soul or spirit.
We believe the mind forms a link between the soul and the body, and
the two interact on each other.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Margaret Stevenson, the first New Zealand Bahá’í
was born on November 30th, 1865. Her first intimation of the Bahá’í
Faith was through reading “The Christian Commonwealth”
and she admitted later that “she did not think any more about
it”. She received this journal from her sister who was in
London studying music and had heard ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
address the congregation of St. John’s, Westminster at the
invitation of Canon Wilberforce. She was so impressed that when
another discourse given by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá at City
Temple, London was printed in “The Christian Commonwealth”
dated March 27th, 1911, she sent a copy of the journal to Margaret in
New Zealand. In 1912, Miss Dorothea Spinney arrived in Auckland from
London and stayed with Margaret at her home, “Clunie”, 3,
Cowie Street, Parnell where she talked about the Bahá’í
Cause and her own meeting with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. To
quote Margaret’s own words: “As a child, I used to wish I
had lived when Christ was on earth. As Miss Spinney spoke, I
remembered my childhood wish, and the thought came to me that I too
might have denied Him as so many others had done. It was this secret
thought that made me seriously think of what I heard from Miss
Spinney, and through God’s grace and mercy I was enabled to
grasp and believe in Bahá’u’lláh and His
Message”.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>
Margaret spoke to others of her belief and obtained literature from
America, becoming a subscriber to “Star of the West”.
Eventually a study group was formed in Auckland and for ten years,
Margaret’s home was a venue for these classes. It was here that
the first Bahá’í Feast in New Zealand took place
in January, 1923.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1925, Margaret was one of a small group who journeyed
from New Zealand to the Holy Land on pilgrimage, and after an
inspiring nineteen days in Haifa, travelled on to England where she
met with the English Bahá’í community. The
pilgrims arrived back in Auckland in December, 1925, bringing with
them some dust from the Tomb of Bahá’u’lláh
which was placed in New Zealand soil at the Stevenson’s home in
a ceremony held on February 14th, 1926.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In such a geographically remote country, the early New
Zealand believers had scant knowledge of Bahá’í
administration and erroneously called themselves an Assembly as early
as 1924. This was corrected with the receipt of a booklet on the
subject and the first properly constituted Bahá’í
Assembly in New Zealand was formed on April 21st, 1926, with Margaret
Stevenson as its Secretary. A steadfast worker, Margaret was a member
of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís
of Australia and New Zealand which was elected in 1934, and served
the Bahá’í Cause with faithfulness and efficiency
until her passing to the Abhá Kingdom on February 11th, 1941.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Born in London in 1855, Hyde Dunn was engaged in
business in Britain and continental Europe before emigrating to the
United States. In 1905, whilst at a tinsmith’s shop in Seattle,
he observed the shopkeeper in excited conversation with a man who had
just returned from the Prison of Akká and the presence of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá; he overheard the quotation “Let
not a man glory in this, that he loves his country, but let him glory
in this, that he loves his kind”. Hyde Dunn later recalled that
“The words reached me with dynamic force, its truth and power
crystallised in my heart--a new consciousness awakened... That
one glorious utterance magnetised my whole being, appealed as a new
note, sent forth from God to His wandering creatures--a Message
from the Supreme to the sons of men”.<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a>
Recognising the Truth, Hyde Dunn interrupted the conversation, and
accepted immediately the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.
The year was 1905.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1912, he was present at a meeting with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
in San Francisco and declared it was the Master’s “penetrating
glance, his life giving words, he felt gave him the power that
enabled him later to become the spiritual conqueror of a continent”.
Accompanied by his English born wife, Clara, he answered the call of
the “Tablets of the Divine Plan” and on April 18th, 1920
reached Australia whence they travelled to New Zealand in 1922–3,
not knowing there was already a believer there (Margaret Stevenson).
With their arrival in Auckland, the Cause grew in that country and
when Hyde Dunn left to return to Australia, Clara remained for a time
to organise a study group in New Zealand.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Known affectionately among Bahá’ís
as “Mother” and “Father” Dunn, they carried
the Message of Bahá’u’lláh from New South
Wales to Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania, across the desert to
Perth and to tropical Queensland and became the spiritual parents of
Australia. After “Mother” Dunn returned from a lone
pilgrimage to the Holy Land, “Father” was elected a
member of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís
of Australia and New Zealand in 1934. After his passing on February
17th, 1941, “Mother” Dunn’s dedication to the
Bahá’í Faith continued unabated and in 1952 she
was elevated to the station of Hand of the Cause of God by Shoghi
Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith:
“Father” Dunn was subsequently elevated to the same
station posthumously.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Despite her advanced years, “Mother” Dunn
returned to New Zealand in 1957 as representative of the Guardian at
the formation of the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís
of New Zealand. In March, 1958, at the request of the Guardian, she
placed plaster from the Castle of Máh-Kú in the
foundations of the Australasian Bahá’í House of
Worship in Sydney during the Australian Inter-Continental Conference.
Until her passing to the Abhá Kingdom in 1960 at the age of 91
years, “Mother” Dunn retained her memory of many Bahá’í
prayers and was reciting these at the time of her death.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Blundell family: Mrs Sarah Blundell was born at
Burwell, Cambridgeshire, England in 1850, a year sacred in Bahá’í
history as that of the Báb’s martyrdom, and was destined
to become one of the pioneers of the Bahá’í Cause
in New Zealand. She received her early religious training from her
“Non-Conformist” father, a man whose strong convictions
led him to withdraw his seven year old daughter from religious
instruction classes at her boarding school. The feeling of isolation
which followed caused her to think for herself and she had the rare
distinction of being one of the first women to enter the Cambridge
University Examinations in an age prejudiced against the education of
women.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1886, with her husband and seven children, she
arrived in New Zealand where she endured hardship and difficulties in
a strange country. She persisted in her unfettered search for truth
and rejected several dogmas until, with an open mind and a prepared
heart, she read in “The Christian Commonwealth” of
‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to London in 1911 and
sent overseas for additional literature. When Mr and Mrs Dunn arrived
in Auckland in 1922–3, Mrs Blundell invited them to her home,
“Lymbury”, Ridings Road, Remuera to meet a group of
twenty people whom she thought might be interested. This was the
first Bahá’í meeting held in New Zealand and
shortly afterwards Mrs Blundell accepted the Bahá’í
Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On hearing from Martha Root that Shoghi Effendi and the
Ladies of the Household were eager to welcome the New Zealand
friends, Sarah Blundell arranged to make the journey to the Holy Land
in 1925 visit the Holy Family, and the Shrines of the Báb,
Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
and to meet in person many other Bahá’ís--this
was “a crowning gift to one whose spiritual path had been
travelled alone.”<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>
She returned to New Zealand after first going home to England to see
her relatives and, at the Guardian’s suggestion, make personal
contact with the English Bahá’í community. She
continued to work unsparingly in New Zealand to serve the Cause of
Bahá’u’lláh until her passing at the age of
eighty-four years on December 20th, 1934.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of her daughters, Ethel Blundell who accepted the
Bahá’í Faith in 1925, was a delegate to the first
Bahá’í Convention and was elected as a member of
the first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís
of Australia and New Zealand in May, 1934.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mrs Blundell’s son, Hugh, was also destined to
serve the Bahá’í Cause. Although not at that time
a Bahá’í, Hugh accompanied his mother and sister
on their pilgrimage to Haifa in 1925 and accepted the Faith the
following year. A tireless worker for the Cause, he was New Zealand’s
first Auxiliary Board Member and passed to the Abhá Kingdom on
October 16th, 1976 in his ninety-second year.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Effie Baker became disenchanted with the Church and,
having an open and enquiring attitude, was one of a committee formed
in Melbourne responsible for arranging speakers to address the “New
Thought” organisation. This led her to attend a public meeting
at which Hyde Dunn spoke on the Bahá’í Faith and,
recognising the truth of the Message, Effie Baker accepted the Faith
the same evening and so became the first woman believer in Australia.
She accompanied Martha Root on the latter’s lecture tour of New
Zealand and, learning of the New Zealand Bahá’ís
projected journey to the Holy Land in 1925, Effie sold her home and
joined the pilgrims.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the bounty of visiting the Shrines and meeting
with the Guardian and the Greatest Holy Leaf, Effie acceded to Shoghi
Effendi’s request and accompanied the New Zealand friends to
London so as to contact the British Bahá’í
community. She planned to return to Australia and assist the Dunns,
and had accepted an invitation from the Ladies of the Holy Family to
stop over in Haifa on her homeward journey, but on arriving there in
June, she found Shoghi Effendi was away from the Holy Land and so
decided to wait until he returned. Her offer to serve was accepted
and she remained at the World Centre of the Bahá’í
Faith in Israel for the next eleven years where she assumed the
duties of hostess, welcoming the friends to the Pilgrim House, using
her artistry and talent to photograph events in Haifa for the
Guardian. In 1930, when the need arose to secure photographs of
places in Persia associated with the early history of the Bahá’í
Faith, Effie undertook arduous journeys by road through Syria and
Iraq, undeterred by danger from hostile bandits. This intrepid worker
now embarked on an exacting and fruitful period of direct service to
the Guardian, often using cars supplied by the Persian believers, at
times travelling on horseback, mule or donkey to all but a few sites
where it was too dangerous for a westerner to venture. The unique
photographic record she obtained was immortalised by being selected
by the Guardian for inclusion in Nabil’s “The
Dawnbreakers”.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1936, Effie returned to her homeland, Australia,
where she looked after the National Archives over a long period. Her
last years were spent in a small flat in the Hazíratu’l-Quds
in Sydney at the invitation of the National Spiritual Assembly of
Australia and New Zealand who had been requested by the Guardian to
take care of her until her passing on January 2nd, 1968.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mrs Amy Dewing and her son Bertram were among New
Zealand’s earliest Bahá’ís; Mrs Dewing came
from an orthodox Church of England background and viewed with
disapproval her son’s questioning attitude which led him to
describe himself as a Rationalist. They heard of and accepted the
Truth of the Bahá’í Cause after meeting with
“Mother” and “Father” Dunn in Devonport,
Auckland and, in 1926, both of them served as members of the first
Local Spiritual Assembly in Auckland. Amy Dewing, as one of a small
and persevering group of New Zealand believers, was active in
spreading the Message as was her son through whose efforts a Bahá’í
magazine was published in Australia and New Zealand to promote the
teachings. Prior to her passing in 1957, Amy Dewing witnessed the
emergence of the New Zealand community as an independent entity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having travelled extensively overseas, Bertram Dewing
eventually settled in Auckland. A tireless worker for the Faith, he
was a member of the first Local Spiritual Assembly in Devonport in
1951 and in 1958 was elected to the second National Spiritual
Assembly of the Bahá’ís of New Zealand. He
pioneered to Hokianga in the same year and a decade later assisted in
spreading the Faith to New Plymouth where he worked for the Cause
with unabated zeal until he passed to the Abhá Kingdom in 1972
at the age of seventy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr Habíb, whose older brother attained martyrdom,
was born in 1888 at Kermán<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">sh</span></span>áh, Persia and was
given the name Mu’ayyad (meaning ‘confirmed’) by
‘Abdu’l-Bahá. At the age of twenty-one, when en
route to Beirut to begin his medical studies at the American
University, he spent a month in the Holy Land with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
who took a personal interest in his progress. Thereafter he returned
each summer to serve the Cause, extending hospitality to visitors and
pilgrims, recording daily events, acquiring spiritual knowledge from
outstanding Bahá’í scholars and being entrusted
with the receipt and dispatch of Tablets. Referring to Habíb’s
student days, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá extolled the young
man’s influence, detachment and sanctity, saying “the
fragrance of Beirut” perfumed His nostrils.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After graduating from the University of Beirut in 1914,
Dr Habíb operated a dispensary at Abú-Sínán,
a Druse village northeast of Akká where the Master had
temporarily settled the Bahá’ís: this period of
close contact with the Holy Family and daily lessons from
‘Abdu’l-Bahá he was later to describe as the “most
precious segment of his life”. In a Tablet to Dr Habíb’s
father, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá described this dedicated
young Bahá’í as “A lamp enkindled with the
love of God”.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1915, responding to the Master’s specific
instructions, Dr Habíb returned to his birthplace to practice
his profession and teach the Faith to which he was so deeply devoted,
and was for forty years a member of the Local Spiritual Assembly of
Kermán<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="text-decoration: underline">sh</span></span>áh, also serving for a period on the
National Spiritual Assembly. His published works include two volumes
of reminiscences based on the principles of the Covenant and the
history of the Cause, whilst his much loved poem entitled “Hold
Thou my Hand, O ‘Abdu’l-Bahá” is widely sung
at gatherings of the Bahá’ís in Írán.
Dr Habíb Mu’ayyad passed to the Abhá Kingdom on
October 29th, 1971.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mrs Emily Axford was born in Huddersfield, England on
October 19th, 1870 and was an infant teacher before her marriage. In
1907, the family emigrated to New Zealand where her husband practiced
medicine in Te Aroha until his passing in 1912, after which Mrs
Axford moved to Auckland so as to educate her three children. Having
rejected conventional Christianity, she was attracted by the New
England Transcendental Movement until she became aware of the Bahá’í
Faith through her friendship with Sarah Blundell and was enrolled as
a member in 1923. Three years later, Mrs Axford was elected Chairman
of the first Local Spiritual Assembly in Auckland and for many years
conducted classes in public speaking to help the friends overcome
their shyness and reticence so that they might teach the Faith
effectively. Emily was one of three New Zealand delegates who
attended the National Convention held in Sydney during 1934 and the
following year was elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Bahá’ís of Australia and New Zealand. She
continued to work staunchly for the Faith, being appointed in 1946 to
the Regional Teaching Committee responsible for formulating teaching
plans throughout New Zealand. The following year, she assumed the
delicate task of conducting negotiations with the immigration
authorities so that Bahá’ís from Persia might be
permitted to enter New Zealand as University students, and was
actively engaged in this work up to the time of her passing on
December 26th, 1949.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Born in 1900, Miss Kitty Carpenter became a Bahá’í
in 1936 since when many members of the Carpenter-Hancock family of
which she is a member have followed her and joined the Faith. An
adventurous and enquiring soul, she undertook her first pilgrimage to
Haifa in 1938, arriving there shortly after the marriage of Shoghi
Effendi and, after living for two years in Australia, she returned to
New Zealand where she embarked on a life of service to the Cause.
Towards the end of the Second World War, she willingly made available
her premises (a counter lunch-shop) in Anzac Avenue as a venue for
the Auckland Bahá’í community and, in the 1950’s,
responded to the call by travel teaching in Mangakino and Whangarei.
She served on the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís
of New Zealand during 1958 and, two years later, moved from
Christchurch to Hamilton to aid in establishing an assembly there.
1964 saw her travel teaching in Invercargill and the following year
she was appointed to the National Teaching Committee. Responding to
the need for the believers to establish another assembly, Kitty
finally made her home in Tauranga where she is an active and much
loved exponent of the Cause.</p>
